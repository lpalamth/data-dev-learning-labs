### HOW TO USE HIVE COMMAND TO INTERACT WITH HIVE CLUSTER###

### <b>Step 1 : Use echo command to find HDFS path</b>

From Hadoop Terminal, use echo command to find the path as shown below:
```jason
echo $HDFS
```
Output of the command is as shown below:

Note: The path obtained needs to be used in all the commands shown below to replace {$HDFS}.

The relative path as shown in the screenshot below would be used in Hive. Please make a note of the same:

### <b> Step 2 : Launch hive environment</b>

Hive interactive environment needs to be launched from terminal.Please follow the steps given below. 

To launch hive environment, please follow the command given below:

```jason
hive
```

### <b> Step 3 : Execute basic commands</b>

Execute some of the basic commands with hive. The commands mentioned below needs to be executed in sequential order.

* Create a new table.

```jason
CREATE TABLE people (id INT, name STRING);
```

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic60.png?raw=true)

* Show the contents of table created.

```jason
SHOW TABLES;
```

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic61.png?raw=true)

* Add new column for table.

```jason
ALTER TABLE people_renamed ADD COLUMNS (new_col INT);
```

To view output:

```jason
describe people_renamed;
```

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic67.png?raw=true)

* Drop Table

```jason
DROP TABLE people_renamed;
```

### <b>Step 4 : Create Table from CSV file in hive</b>

Learn how to create a table from csv file in hive interactive environment. The commands mentioned below needs to be executed in sequential order.

* Exit from hive interactive environment and execute the following commands in hdfs terminal. To exit from hive interactive environment, execute the command mentioned below:

```jason
exit;
```

* Create a new data file directory(students) with hdfs command.

```jason
hdfs dfs –mkdir ${HDFS}students;
```

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic69.png?raw=true)


* Copy demo data existing in hadoop(hive_students.csv) to the directory created - students.

```jason
hdfs dfs –cp ${HDFS}hive_students.csv ${HDFS}students;
```

* Enter Hive interactive environment and execute the following commands in Hive.

To launch Hive environment, please follow the command given below:

```jason
hive;
```
![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic58.png?raw=true)

The hive prompt is as shown below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic59.png?raw=true)

* Create an external table in Hive interactive environment.

```jason
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE students (id INT, name STRING, birthday STRING) 
    COMMENT 'hive demo table'
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    STORED AS TEXTFILE
location '/user/570c977d4758c1b01983de10/292c1fa0-4c7c-4f91-a03b-a6e1d9246ace/students';
```
The path shown in location is the relative path and not the full path. Replace this relative path from Step 1 as shown below:

<b>location</b>: Relative path obtained from step 1 + students

/user/U58350d4b979c5a583eb43c64/292c1fa0-4c7c-4f91-a03b-a6e1d9246ace/students

```jason
SELECT name FROM students WHERE birthday ='2015-08-20';
```

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic74.png?raw=true)

* Insert the results of "Select" command into a new table in Hive.

```jason
CREATE TABLE students_sub (id INT, name STRING, birthday STRING) ;
```

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic76.png?raw=true)

```jason
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE students_sub SELECT a.* FROM students a where a.birthday > '2015-08-20';
```
![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/HADOOP 101 WITH BASIC TERMINAL HANDS-ON EXERCISES/assets/images/HadoopBasic77.png?raw=true)

### <b>Step 6: Explore other commands in Hadoop</b>

To explore more commands , exit from hive environment using the command given below.

```jason
exit;
```
From HDFS, use help command as shown below:

```jason
hdfs dfs –help
```

Output of the command is as shown below:
