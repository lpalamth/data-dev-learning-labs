# <center>NETWORK DATA TRANSFORMATION AND VISUALIZATION USING TABLEAU</center>

<b>Executed on</b>: Hadoop Big Data Platform

<b>Visualization tool used</b>: Tableau


## OVERVIEW

This learning lab can be used as a guide to get a high level understanding on the process of ingesting network data in to Hadoop environment, perform transformation & extraction and visualize using an analytical tool called Tableau. We will be using DevNet Data Learning Platform referred as "DLP" during the course. In this lab, the network stream data is already pre-created. From DLP platform, the user can access it directly. 

Please refer the example shown below to get a high level understanding :

A data collection server, as shown in the diagram below, is collecting data in real time from the local network. The data collected by the Server is working with a Client residing in DLP to transfer the network data collected through Kafka. Using Kafka socket code, we are making a connection to the client that captures the network data and sends it to a Kafka topic. From this topic, data will be moved to HDFS by a Consumer program. With the data present in HDFS, we can further transform it and visalize in different formats such as pie chart, bar chart etc. using Tableau tool. The diagram shows how exactly network data flows from a local network through Kafka in HDFS and gets transformed.

## TERMINOLOGIES USED


### WHAT IS NETWORK DATA? - AN INTRODUCTION

The Computer network is a telecommunication process which allows computers or devices to exchange data between each other using data pipeline and those devices that are controlled by wired or wireless medium. Those devices are kept alive by exchanging data between each other in a continuous way. 

These network data provide the inside details about communication performance between of two devices that are communicating. We can extract lots of valuable information from those data set if we can capture those data in real time. 

## APACHE KAFKA? - AN INTRODUCTION

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is designed to be fast, scalable, and durable. It has 3 key capabilities:

1.	It lets you publish and subscribe to streams of records. In this respect it is similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
2.	It lets you store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way.
3.	It lets you process streams of records as they occur.

It is used for two broad classes of application:

1.	Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
2.	Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data

### TABLEAU - AN INTRODUCTION

Tableau is a powerful business intelligence and analytics tool. There are mainly five main products catering to diverse visualization needs for professionals and organizations. They are:

Tableau Desktop: Made for individual use
Tableau Server: Collaboration for any organization
Tableau Online: Business Intelligence in the Cloud
Tableau Reader: Let you read files saved in Tableau Desktop.
Tableau Public: For journalists or anyone to publish interactive data online.

Tableau Desktop is a data visualization application that lets you analyze virtually any type of structured data and produce highly interactive, beautiful graphs, dashboards, and reports. You can connect to virtually any data source from spreadsheets to data warehouses and display information in multiple graphic perspectives.

### DLP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

The DevNet Data Learning Platform (DLP) is an integrated data platform from CISCO that includes an easy-to-use UI, Docker-    based infrastructure, best-in-class open-source big-data components, and Cisco’s APIs and tools for data developers and data  scientists who want to develop, validate and provision their solutions before deploying or to explore, analyze, and    visualize their data. The DLP environment comes with an inbuilt cloud based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built    on Hadoop.

### <b>Step 9 : Explore Data using Tableau</b>

User can now explore the data with drag and drop operations and create reports.

The user can select the required field(s) and view the data in desired format. For example, select ip_src(IP address of source devices) and ip_dest(IP address of destination devices) fields from Dimensions column and place it as shown in the below screen. 
It will generate the output as dot marks that shows there is traffic flow between two devices. IP addresses of devices which are communicating with each other are marked on X-axis and Y-Axis respectively. Please refer the screenshot below:
