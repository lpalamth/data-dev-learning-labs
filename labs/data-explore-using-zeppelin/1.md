### APACHE SPARK - AN INTRODUCTION 

Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework. Spark is advertised as “lightning fast cluster computing”. It has a thriving open-source community and is the most active Apache project at the moment. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault-tolerance. Apache Spark provides programmers with an application programming interface centered on a data structure called the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. 

It was developed in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs. MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store reduction results on disk. Spark provides a faster and more general data processing platform.

###### Key Features

1. Currently provides APIs in Scala, Java, and Python, with support for other languages (such as R) on the way
2. Integrates well with the Hadoop ecosystem and data sources (HDFS, Amazon S3, Hive, HBase, Cassandra, etc.)
3. Can run on clusters managed by Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos, and can also run standalone

###### How to Use Apache Spark? 

###### Example : Using spark to detect an earthquake by analyzing the twitter stream

1. Using Spark streaming, filter tweets that seem relevant like “earthquake” or “shaking”. 

2. Run semantic analysis on the tweets to determine if they appear to be referencing a current earthquake occurrence. Tweets like ”Earthquake!” or ”Now it is shaking”, for example, would be considered positive matches, whereas tweets like “Attending an Earthquake Conference” or ”The earthquake yesterday was scary” would not. 

3. Using the streaming technique we could detects the  positive tweets in a defined time window and thereby can be used to send alert messages.

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/welcome-to-zeppelin.PNG?raw=true)

###### Step 10:

Provide a name to the notebook being created in the pop-up window shown.

![Figure](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/TryZeppelin.jpeg?raw=true)

###### Step 11:

The Zeppelin interactive,development and visualisation environment is ready for use and would look as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Try Zeppelin 2.jpeg?raw=true)

###### Step 12:

We will use code written in Apache Spark to create resilient distributed dataset (RDD) on bank-full.csv file in this step. The file bank-full.csv is already loaded in Hadoop environment.</br>

The code is as follows:
```jason
val bankText = sc.textFile("hdfs://xx.xx.xx.xx:xxxx/yourPath/bank/bank-full.csv")  
//Replace the bank-full.csv file path.

case class Bank(age:Integer, job:String, marital : String, education : String, balance : Integer)

// split each line, filter out header (starts with "age"), and map it into Bank case class
 
val bank = bankText.map(s=>s.split(";")).filter(s=>s(0)!="\"age\"").map(  
       s=>Bank(s(0).toInt, 
            s(1).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(2).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(3).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(5).replaceAll("\"", "").toInt  
        )  
)
bank.toDF().registerTempTable("bank")
```

Following functions are being done by the Spark Code :

-    Header removal using filter function and data transformation from csv format into RDD of Bank objects.
-    RDD conversion to DataFrame and temporary table creation with name “bank”.
</br>

###### Step 13:

Copy the Apache Spark code to the Zeppelin notebook created in previous step. This will help to load the data file from Hadoop.

In the code, replace the bank-full.csv file path. The path to be replaced can be obtained from the DLP landing page as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Bank file path.jpeg?raw=true)

Copy the path from DLP landing page(see the screenshot above) and replace with the same in Zeppelin notebook as shown in the screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/sparkCode.png?raw=true)

###### Step 14:

After replacing the bank-full.csv file path in Zeppelin, Execute the code by clicking on the icon highlighted as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Try Zeppelin 3.jpeg?raw=true)
</br>

###### Step 15:

On successful execution of code, the screen would be as shown in the screenshot below:

The icon changed to Finished and there would not be any errors shown on the screen.

Below screen is showing that the spark RDD is created successfully and creation of a temporary table name "bank" is also done.
![Figure](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Try Zeppelin 4.jpeg?raw=true)

###### Step 16:

We have now completed the data loading process. We will use SQL queries in Zeppelin to retrieve and visualize the data loaded. Let's try a few examples to visualize the data in Zeppelin.

<b>Example 1:</b> Age distribution of data that is stored in bank RDD. 
</br>
Copy the below query to Zeppelin Editor and execute the same.

```sql
%sql 
select age, count(1) from bank where age < 30 group by age order by age
```

Change the graph type to pie chart and view the output as shown below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Example1_Pie.jpeg?raw=true)


<b>Example 2:</b> Input run-time data as input box and display output. 

Copy the below query to Zeppelin Editor and execute the same.

```sql
%sql
select age, count(1) from bank where age < ${maxAge=30} group by age order by age
```

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Example 2.jpeg?raw=true)
</br>

Enter value as 28 in the input box, select graph type as pie chart and view the output as shown below.

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Example2_pie.jpeg?raw=true)



<b>Example 3:</b> Using dynamic sql query to select data from a drop down list box. 

Copy the below query to Zeppelin Editor and execute the same.

```sql
%sql
select age, count(1) from bank where marital = "${marital=single,single|divorced|married}" group by age order by age
```
The output displays the age distribution with marital status and a combo box to select marital status as shown in the screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Example3.jpeg?raw=true)

Select value as "Married" from the combo box, select graph type as "Graph" and view the output as shown below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Example3_Graph.jpeg?raw=true)
