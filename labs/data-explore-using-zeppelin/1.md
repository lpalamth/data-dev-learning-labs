### APACHE SPARK - AN INTRODUCTION 

Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework. Spark is advertised as “lightning fast cluster computing”. It has a thriving open-source community and is the most active Apache project at the moment. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault-tolerance. Apache Spark provides programmers with an application programming interface centered on a data structure called the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. 

It was developed in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs. MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store reduction results on disk. Spark provides a faster and more general data processing platform.

###### Key Features

1. Currently provides APIs in Scala, Java, and Python, with support for other languages (such as R) on the way
2. Integrates well with the Hadoop ecosystem and data sources (HDFS, Amazon S3, Hive, HBase, Cassandra, etc.)
3. Can run on clusters managed by Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos, and can also run standalone

###### How to Use Apache Spark? 

###### Example : Using spark to detect an earthquake by analyzing the twitter stream

1. Using Spark streaming, filter tweets that seem relevant like “earthquake” or “shaking”. 

2. Run semantic analysis on the tweets to determine if they appear to be referencing a current earthquake occurrence. Tweets like ”Earthquake!” or ”Now it is shaking”, for example, would be considered positive matches, whereas tweets like “Attending an Earthquake Conference” or ”The earthquake yesterday was scary” would not. 

3. Using the streaming technique we could detects the  positive tweets in a defined time window and thereby can be used to send alert messages.

![Figure](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Try Zeppelin 2.jpeg?raw=true)

###### Step 11:

We will use code written in Apache Spark to create resilient distributed dataset (RDD) on bank-full.csv file in this step. The file bank-full.csv is already loaded in Hadoop environment.</br>

The code is as follows:
```jason
val bankText = sc.textFile("hdfs://xx.xx.xx.xx:xxxx/yourPath/bank/bank-full.csv")  
//Replace the bank-full.csv file path.

case class Bank(age:Integer, job:String, marital : String, education : String, balance : Integer)

// split each line, filter out header (starts with "age"), and map it into Bank case class
 
val bank = bankText.map(s=>s.split(";")).filter(s=>s(0)!="\"age\"").map(  
       s=>Bank(s(0).toInt, 
            s(1).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(2).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(3).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(5).replaceAll("\"", "").toInt  
        )  
)
bank.toDF().registerTempTable("bank")
```

Following functions are being done by the Spark Code :

-    Header removal using filter function and data transformation from csv format into RDD of Bank objects.
-    RDD conversion to DataFrame and temporary table creation with name “bank”.
</br>

###### Step 11:

Copy the Apache Spark code to the Zeppelin notebook created in previous step. This will help to load the data file from Hadoop.

In the code, replace the bank-full.csv file path. The path to be replaced can be obtained from the DLP landing page as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Bank file path.jpeg?raw=true)

Copy the path from DLP landing page(see the screenshot above) and replace with the same in Zeppelin notebook as shown in the screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/sparkCode.png?raw=true)

<b>Step 3.3 </b>Copy the bank-full.csv file path from <b>Data Repository</b>.</br>
For changing the bank-full.csv file path, copy the path from <b>Data Repository</b> section and replace it in above code.
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/csvFilePath.PNG?raw=true)
</br>
<b>Step 3.4</b> Update the bank-full.csv file path in the Zeppelin notebook and execute the code.</br>
After replaceing the bank-full.csv file path in the spark code, paste the code in Zeppelin notebook editor and it would be like below. Click on the Execute button marked in Red in below image.
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/ZeppelineEditorWithSparkCode1.PNG?raw=true)
</br>
<b>Step 3.5</b> Spark code execution status from Zeppelin notebook.</br>
Below screen is showing that the spark RDD is created successfully and creation of a temporary table name "bank" is also done.

## Step 4: Data Retrieval using SQL.

Data load process is done in above steps. We will use some sql queries to retrieve the data and display it in a different format. 
We will try three consecutive examples to check the output in Zeppelin.

<b>Example 1:</b> We want to see the age distribution of data which are stored in bank RDD. 
</br>Use the below query in Zeppelin Editor and execute the query in Zeppelin editor

```sql
%sql 
select age, count(1) from bank where age < 30 group by age order by age
```
![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/sqlQuery1.PNG?raw=true)

Change the graph type to pie chart and view the output as below.
![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/example1-1image.png?raw=true)

<b>Example 2:</b> Use the below SQL query to input run-time data as input box and display output. 

```sql
%sql
select age, count(1) from bank where age < ${maxAge=30} group by age order by age
```
![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Example-2image.png?raw=true)
</br>
Enter value as 21 in the input box, output would be like below.
![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/Example-2-1.png?raw=true)

<b>N.B: User can try with any values and view the output.</b>

<b>Example 3:</b> Using dynamic sql query to select data from a drop down list box in Zeppelin is showing in this example. Paste the sql in Zeppelin's editor and execute the query after changing the values based on your choice.

You can make input box for setting age condition by replacing 30 with ${maxAge=30}.

```sql
%sql
select age, count(1) from bank where marital = "${marital=single,single|divorced|married}" group by age order by age
```
Now we want to see age distribution with certain marital status and add a combo box to select marital status.

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/zepplelinListbox.PNG?raw=true)

By running the above paragraphs of SQL queries, you will get corresponding visual result like below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/comboImageResult.PNG?raw=true)


 **Things to Try**

- Try with different queries.
- Try with inner queries.

From this, we have learned how to use the Zeppelin with different types of SQL queries.
