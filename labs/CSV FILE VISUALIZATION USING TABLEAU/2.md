**Step 4**. Explore the data with drag and drop operations, and create some report.
For example, if you want to create a report to view how many “UDP” and “ICMP” packages are received in each minute, please follow these steps:

	1)	Right click on “receive_time” field.
	2)	Click “Create calculated field …”
	3)	Create a new field named “receive_time_new”, which is generated by apply DATETIME operator to “receive_time” filed

	4)	Drag "Number of Records" from "Measures" to "Columns"
	5)	Drag "protocol" field from "Dimensions" to "Rows"
	6) 	Click the "TCP" tag, and then click "Exclude".

	7)	 Drag “receive_time_new” from Dimensions to Rows, and then right click “YEAR(receive_time_new)”, and then select “Minute”,

	8)  Change the "Marks" type from "Automatic" to "Bar" type. The final report looks like the following example.
