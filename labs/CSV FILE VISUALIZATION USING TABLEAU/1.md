5. The file size should be smaller than 50 MB.<br>


## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. To get familiarized with the DLP (Data Learning Platform).

2. To get familiarized with the ways to get data from a file. 

3. To get familiarized with the ways to use preloaded network data from HDFS platform and analyse the same to check how many UDP(User Datagram Protocol) and ICMP(Internet control message protocol) packages have been received in each second.

3. To get familiarized with data visualization using Tableau.


## TERMINOLOGIES USED


### TABLEAU - AN INTRODUCTION

Tableau is a powerful business intelligence and analytics tool. There are mainly five main products catering to diverse visualization needs for professionals and organizations. They are:

Tableau Desktop: Made for individual use
Tableau Server: Collaboration for any organization
Tableau Online: Business Intelligence in the Cloud
Tableau Reader: Let you read files saved in Tableau Desktop.
Tableau Public: For journalists or anyone to publish interactive data online.

Tableau Desktop is a data visualization application that lets you analyze virtually any type of structured data and produce highly interactive, beautiful graphs, dashboards, and reports. You can connect to virtually any data source from spreadsheets to data warehouses and display information in multiple graphic perspectives.

### DLP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

The DevNet Data Learning Platform (DLP) is an integrated data platform from CISCO that includes an easy-to-use UI, Docker-    based infrastructure, best-in-class open-source big-data components, and Cisco’s APIs and tools for data developers and data  scientists who want to develop, validate and provision their solutions before deploying or to explore, analyze, and    visualize their data. The DLP environment comes with an inbuilt cloud based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built    on Hadoop.

### <b>Step 7 : Explore Tableau</b>

User can now explore the data with drag and drop operations and create reports.

For example, if you want to create a report to view how many “UDP” and “ICMP” packages are received each minute, please follow the steps given below:

1. Right click on “receive_time” field.
2. Click “Create calculated field …”
3. Create a new field named “receive_time_new”, which is generated by applying DATETIME operator to “receive_time” field as shown below:

![Creating a new field](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/vizualize-csv-tableau/assets/images/receive_time_new_field.png?raw=true)


4. Drag "Number of Records" from "Measures" to "Columns"
5. Drag "protocol" field from "Dimensions" to "Rows"
6. Click the "TCP" tag, and then click "Exclude".

![Excluding TCP](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/vizualize-csv-tableau/assets/images/MessureSelection11.PNG?raw=true)

7. Drag “receive_time_new” from Dimensions to Rows, and then right click “YEAR(receive_time_new)”, and then select “Minute”,

![Configuring rows](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/vizualize-csv-tableau/assets/images/configure_rows.png?raw=true)

8. Change the "Marks" type from "Automatic" to "Bar" type. The final report looks as shown in the screenshot below.
