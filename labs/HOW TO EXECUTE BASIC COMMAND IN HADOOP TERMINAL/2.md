### HOW TO USE APACHE SPARK-SHELL TO INTERACT WITH SPARK CLUSTER###

###### Step 1:
Spark shell interactive environment needs to be launched from terminal.Please follow the steps given below. User could launch the Spark shell interactive environment either in local mode or in cluster mode but not in both of them.

To launch in Local Mode, please follow the command given below:

```jason
spark-shell
```

To launch in cluster Mode, please follow the command given below:

```jason
spark-shell --master yarn --deploy-mode client
```

###### Step 3:

Execute word count transformation program with basic spark code as follows. The commands mentioned below needs to be executed in sequential order.

```jason
val inputfile = sc.textFile("${HDFS}hadoop-learning-labs-people.txt")
```
Output of the command is as shown below:

```jason
val counts = inputfile.flatMap(line => line.split(" ")).map(word => (word, 1)).reduceByKey(_+_);
```
Output of the command is as shown below:
