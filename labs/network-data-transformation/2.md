###### Step 10: 

On click of launch, user will be navigated to a pre-configured IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Select the file “TransformData.java” from left pane on IDE work space. Double click on the file and it will open up in the right panel. Please refer the screenshot below:

###### Step 11: 

From the top pane of IDE, select CMD as “Package” and click on blue icon (![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/word-count-using-spark/assets/images/icon.jpeg?raw=true)) as shown in the screenshot below:

Note : This will help to build and package the scala program.

###### Step 12: 

Check the console for a successful completion message:

###### Step 13: 

We need to perform below settings before we run the program and generate the result. Below steps describe the process of generating and saving the output from the above program in the Hadoop platform. 
a)	Select the <b>run.sh</b> file from the left panel and double click on it. The contents of the file will open in the right panel.

There are three parameters mentioned in this script file. Change the values as described below and Select the CMD as “run” and click on blue icon(![alt-tag](https://github.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/word-count-using-spark/assets/images/icon.jpeg?raw=true)) as shown in the screenshot below:

* USER: your current login user name </br>

<b>N.B</b> Enter your loggedin userid. If you have logged in as user_1 then enter user_1 as USER. </br>

* INPUT: The file name in “Data Repository” section that you want to transform. </br>

<b>N.B:</b> Sample preloaded network data file(network_origin.csv) is already saved in HDFS environment. User can use this file as an example.</br>

* OUTPUT: The output file name that the code will generate.  </br>

<b>N.B</b> Provide a output file name. For example, <b>network_transform_result.csv</b> is used as a output file name here. Output of the program would be saved in this file and the file would be saved in Hadoop environment directly. <b>Change this file name based on your choice. </b>

###### Step 14: 

Check the console for a successful completion message:


###### Step 15: 

After executing the above script, DLP's Cloud IDE will generate the output file and save directly in the Hadoop platform. We can view the output using visualisation tool - Tableau.
