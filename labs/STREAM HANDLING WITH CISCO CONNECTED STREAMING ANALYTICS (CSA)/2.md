...Contd.

###### Step 16:

Navigate to DLP and click on the <b>Drill</b> button shown on top-right corner of the screen as shown in screenshot below:

![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image1DrillButton.PNG?raw=true)


###### Step 17:

User would be presented with two options - Zeppelin and Jupyter. Select Zeppelin.

(The pop-up may be blocked in browser configuration. Click on the red pop up blocker icon and select <b>Always allow pop-up from http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx </b> and click on <b>Done</b> button.) </br> 

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/popUpBlockerAllowed.PNG?raw=true).

###### Step 18:

On enabling the pop-up, Zeppelin would open in a new tab taking the user to Zeppelin home page. Next, we need to configure Zeppelin. 
From DLP, when the Trucq micro service is running, we need to obtain the IP and Port details. Please refer <b>Step 8</b> for more details. Please refer the screenshot below for more details:

###### Step 18:

On Zeppelin, we need to edit the PSQL configuration with below mentioned parameters.<br>

Click <b>Interpreter</b> from Zepplin and go to <b>psql</b> section. After clicking on <b>Edit</b> button, edit the respective details given below and click on <b>Save</b> button. Please refer the screenshot below for more details:

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ZapplineConfigurationRestartImage.png?raw=true) </br>

```
postgresql.driver.name    :  org.postgresql.Driver
postgresql.max.result     :  1000
postgresql.password	  : 
postgresql.url		  :  jdbc:postgresql://10.10.10.92:11841/cqdb
postgresql.user	          :  trucq

```

After clicking on <b>Save</b> button, click the <b>OK</b> button for final updation. </br>

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ZapplineConfigurationUpdate.PNG?raw=true)

After setting the above value, click on the <b>Restart</b> button.

Now we have completed the settings in Zeppelin. We can now apply SQL queries on Zeppelin for interacting with Postgresql database and display output in graphical format. Next, we need to configure a Zeppelin notbook editor where we can insert SQL queries. Below steps describe the process of configuring Zeppelin notebook.

</br></br>

###### Step 19:

On the Zeppelin homepage, create your own notebook by clicking on &quot;Create new note&quot; as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/welcome-to-zeppelin-notebook.png?raw=true)

###### Step 20:

Provide a name to the notebook being created in the pop-up window shown. 

![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/create-note.png?raw=true)

###### Step 21:

The Zeppelin interactive,development and visualisation environment is ready for use and would look as shown in screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/ZapplineIntf.PNG?raw=true)

###### Step 21:

Till now, we have configured the process of reading log data from multiple Web servers located at different locations.Next, we will query using sql to view the log data residing in postgresql database(refer previous steps). User can monitor the log status from log data using sql query and display the data in different format(table/graph) as per their choice. 

```
%psql
select * from apachelog.sapachelog_archive order by access_time DESC limit 300
```
Input the above mentioned sql query in the Zeppelin notebox created and execute the query by clicking on the Execute button highlighted in the screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/sqlinZeppelin.PNG?raw=true)

###### Step 22:

On successful execution of code, user can view the output as shown in screenshot below. It is showing the web server's log server data from CSA engine. These log data are stored in the postgresql database. 

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ZepplinePreview.png?raw=true)

###### Step 23:
On clicking the Settings icon as indicated in previous screenshot, we can drag/drop the fields and display the output as graph format. User can change the graph type as desired.
