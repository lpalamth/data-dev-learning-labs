**SECTION C: BUILD AND EXPORT TRANSFORMATION JOB USING TALEND BIG DATA TOOL TO USER'S LOCAL COMPUTER.** 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In this section, the user will learn the process of building and exporting job that has been created in previous section from Talend tool. 

###### Step 1:

Right click on the job name and select <b>Build Job</b> from the menu. It will open an UI from where user can select the type of build process. Please refer the screenshot below:

![build-job](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-transformation-with-talend/assets/images/buildJob1.png?raw=true)

###### Step 2:

Click on the <b>Browse...</b> button and save the job as a zip file. </br>

###### Step 3:

Select <b>Standalone Job</b> from <b>Select the build type</b> list box.</br>

**SECTION D: UPLOAD THE TRANSFORMATION JOB TO DLP PLATFORM** 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In this section, the user will learn the process of uploading transformation job to DLP platform. 

###### Step 1:

Navigate to DLP platform - Data Repository tab, select the file <b>User11.csv</b> file and click on <b>Transform</b> button as shown in screenshot below:

###### Step 2:

The Transformation interface will open up in another tab of your browser. You can preview the content of the source file(Users11.csv) here. There are three sections available: </br>

* In-build Transformation functions: System defined transformation functions would be available here. </br>
* My transformation functions: User's uploaded transformation functions would be available here.</br>
* Community Provided functions: User can share their transformation function(s) for community people. All those transformation   jobs would be available here which are shared any any user. </br>

<b>N.B: Only "My transformation" function is implemented now.</b> </br>

###### Step 3:

Click on <b>Upload</b> icon. Please refer the screenshot below. On click of Upload icon, it will open a pop-up form.

**SECTION E: EXECUTE TRANSFORMATION FROM DLP PLATFORM AND VISUALIZE THE DATA.** 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

###### Step 1:

Navigate to <b>My transformation functions</b> and find the uploaded job from the job list. 

###### Step 2:

Select the job and job details would be displayed. Enter the output file name in <b>Name for the new generated data file</b> section.

###### Step 3:

Click on <b>Start Transform</b> button for starting the transformation.

###### Step 4:

Output will be generated and saved in hadoop. User can view the file directly. In the output file, country field which is empty in source file(Users11.csv) is marked as "NoCountry". First Name and last name fields are merged and capitalized in output file.
