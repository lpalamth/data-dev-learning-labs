## TERMINOLOGIES USED


### APACHE ZEPPELIN - AN INTRODUCTION

Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. You can make beautiful data-driven, interactive and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more. </br>

Zeppelin enables data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organising, executing, and sharing data code and visualising results without referring to the command line or knowing the cluster details. It brings data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Spark. It supports Python and also a growing list of programming languages such as Scala, Hive, SparkSQL, shell and markdown. The various languages are supported via Zeppelin language interpreters. Zeppelin’s notebooks provides interactive snippet-at-time experience to data scientist.


###### Key Features:

1. Web based notebook style editor.

2. Built-in Apache Spark support.

###### Use Cases for Zeppelin :

1. Data Exploration and discovery

2. Data Visualization - Tables,graphs and charts

3. Interactive snippet-at-a-time experience

4. Collaboration and publishing

### APACHE SPARK - AN INTRODUCTION 

Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework. Spark is advertised as “lightning fast cluster computing”. It has a thriving open-source community and is the most active Apache project at the moment. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault-tolerance. Apache Spark provides programmers with an application programming interface centered on a data structure called the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. 

It was developed in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs. MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store reduction results on disk. Spark provides a faster and more general data processing platform.

###### Key Features

1. Currently provides APIs in Scala, Java, and Python, with support for other languages (such as R) on the way
2. Integrates well with the Hadoop ecosystem and data sources (HDFS, Amazon S3, Hive, HBase, Cassandra, etc.)
3. Can run on clusters managed by Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos, and can also run standalone

###### How to Use Apache Spark? 

###### Example : Using spark to detect an earthquake by analyzing the twitter stream

1. Using Spark streaming, filter tweets that seem relevant like “earthquake” or “shaking”. 

2. Run semantic analysis on the tweets to determine if they appear to be referencing a current earthquake occurrence. Tweets like ”Earthquake!” or ”Now it is shaking”, for example, would be considered positive matches, whereas tweets like “Attending an Earthquake Conference” or ”The earthquake yesterday was scary” would not. 

3. Using the streaming technique we could detects the  positive tweets in a defined time window and thereby can be used to send alert messages.

![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image6ZeppelineNotebookEditor.PNG?raw=true)

###### Step 12:
We will use code written in Python for data generation.</br>

The code is as follows:
```json
%python
import numpy as np                                                     #Import numpy library
x = np.linspace( -np.pi, np.pi , 1000)                                 #Define a numpy array which should be eventually distributed along (-Pi, Pi).
y = np.cos(x)                                                          #Define an array y = cos(x)
print x,y                                                              #Print the cosine signal data
```
Following functions are being done by the Python Code :

1. Import numpy library from Zeppelin UI. </br>

  *Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python. It contains very powerful mathematical functions.   In this learning lab, we will make use of functions defined in Numpy to create cosine signal data.</br>
  
2. Numpy array definition that is eventually distributed along (-Pi, Pi). The syntax of numpy.linspace is as given below :
   numpy.linspace(start, stop, num=50, endpoint=True, retstep=False, dtype=None)
</br>
    For more details, please refer:
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html </br>

3. Array definition : y=cos(x). </br>
4. Printing all the <b>cosine</b> values from array. </br>

###### Step 13:

Copy the Python code to the Zeppelin notebook created in previous step and execute the code by clicking on the icon highlighted as shown in screenshot below:. 

![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/pythonCodeLoadData1.png?raw=true)
</br>

###### Step 14:
On successful execution of code, user can view the cosine signal data in Zeppelin as shown in screenshot below:

![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/pythonCodeLoadDataOutput1.PNG?raw=true)

###### Step 15:

In the previous step, we have created the cosine signal data. Now we need to plot the cosine wave.In order to plot the cosine wave, we will use <b>Matplotlib</b> which is a python 2D plotting library that produces quality figures in a variety of formats and interactive environments across platforms. </br>

Below is the python code that will help to draw the Cosine wave from cosine data. </br>

```json
%python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                                        #Import matplotlib library
import StringIO

plt.plot(x,y)                                                          #Plot the cosine signal in memory

img = StringIO.StringIO()                                              #Create StringIO object which named img
plt.savefig(img, format='svg')                                         #Save the figure in svg format
img.seek(0)                                                            #Get the memory of the figure
print "%html <div style='width:300pt'>" + img.buf + "</div>"           #Show the cosine signal curve
```

Following functions are being done by the Python Code :</br>

i)   Import of Matplotlib, StringIO library in Zeppelin. </br>
ii)  Plot the cosine wave in memory. </br>
iii) Creation of StringIO object for reading string buffer data from memory. </br>
iv)  Creation of an image with cosine data reading from memory in svg format. </br>
v)   Obtain the starting memory address of the image created in previous step. </br>
vi)  Display of output as cosine wave in Zeppelin UI. </br>

###### Step 16:
