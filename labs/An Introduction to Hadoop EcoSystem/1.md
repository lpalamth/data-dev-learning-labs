# <center>AN INTRODUCTION TO APACHE HADOOP ECOSYSTEM</center>

Executed on : Hadoop Terminal

## OVERVIEW

This learning lab can be used as a guide to get a high level understanding of Apache Hadoop. The prime focus would be to

1. Get a basic understanding of Hadoop infrastructure.

2. Learn how to operate hdfs file via hdfs command. 

3.	Learn how to use spark-sell to interactive with spark cluster.

4.	Learn how to use hive command to interactive with hive cluster

 We will be using DevNet Data Learning Platform referred as "DLP" during the course. 

## PRE-REQUISITES

1.	Install Chrome Browser.

2.	Obtain access to the Data Learning Platform by creating an account at https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/d8b9476d-cb6f-4b44-a236-b8ebdb3d3ef9?diagramType=Topology (Detailed instructions given below)


## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. To get familiarized with the DLP (Data Learning Platform)

2. To get familiarized with Apache Hadoop.

3. To get familiarized with the terminal usage for executing HDFS commands.

## TERMINOLOGIES USED

### HADOOP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. To understand Hadoop, there are two fundamental things about it -  How Hadoop stores files and how it processes data.The framework that is used in hadoop to process data is called MapReduce.

All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common and should be automatically handled by the framework. The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part, known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and a processing part called MapReduce. Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster.

Example : Imagine a file that is larger than the capacity of a computer then it would not be possible to store that file. Hadoop allows to store files bigger than what can be stored on one particular node or server. So it provides an ability to store very, very large files and also lets to store many, many files.

### DLP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

The DevNet Data Learning Platform (DLP) is a Big-Data learning platform connected with an easy to learn UI to help you break into the world of Big-Data development.  Backed with Docker, best-in-class open source Big-Data tools and Cisco API’s, Big-Data Scientists and Developers can leverage DLP to easily build solutions, visualize data and turn POC’s for production applications. The DLP environment comes with an inbuilt cloud based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built on Hadoop.
