# <center>VIDEO ANALYTICS USING APACHE SPARK STREAMING</center>

Processing Engine Used : Apache Spark

Stream Processing Platform Used : Apache Kafka

Executed on : Hadoop Big Data Platform

## OVERVIEW

This learning lab can be used as a guide to get a high level understanding of video analytics using Apache Spark streaming.
The application mentioned here uses micro service for video data ingestion which reads the video data from mockup video source and forwards the data to Kafka broker. The sample code shown in this learning lab reads the video data from Kafka broker which detects the face image(s) and saves those image(s) to HDFS platform. We will be using DevNet Data Learning Platform referred as "DLP" during the course. The User can view the face image(s) from DLP platform.</br>

In this lab, we integrate Apache Spark Streaming with Kafka, detect a human face using OpenCV from a video streaming and then save the result to an image file in Hadoop environment. We have used a mockup video source for demonstrating an example. In real time, user can use a live video streaming from a real camera and write a video source service for reading the live streaming data and send the data from the camera to kafka thereby replacing  the mockup video source.

## TERMINOLOGIES USED

### APACHE SPARK - AN INTRODUCTION 

Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework. Spark is advertised as “lightning fast cluster computing”. It has a thriving open-source community and is the most active Apache project at the moment. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault-tolerance. Apache Spark provides programmers with an application programming interface centered on a data structure called the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. 

It was developed in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs. MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store reduction results on disk. Spark provides a faster and more general data processing platform.

###### What is Spark Streaming?

Spark Streaming is a key component of Spark, a massively successful open source project in the recent years. Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Twitter, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high-level functions like map-reduce, join and window. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to file systems, databases, and live dashboards. 

###### Key Features

1. Currently provides APIs in Scala, Java, and Python, with support for other languages (such as R) on the way
2. Integrates well with the Hadoop ecosystem and data sources (HDFS, Amazon S3, Hive, HBase, Cassandra, etc.)
3. Can run on clusters managed by Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos, and can also run standalone

###### How to Use Apache Spark? 

###### Example : Using spark to detect an earthquake by analyzing the twitter stream

1. Using Spark streaming, filter tweets that seem relevant like “earthquake” or “shaking”. 

2. Run semantic analysis on the tweets to determine if they appear to be referencing a current earthquake occurrence. Tweets like ”Earthquake!” or ”Now it is shaking”, for example, would be considered positive matches, whereas tweets like “Attending an Earthquake Conference” or ”The earthquake yesterday was scary” would not. 

3. Using the streaming technique we could detects the  positive tweets in a defined time window and thereby can be used to send alert messages.

## APACHE KAFKA? - AN INTRODUCTION

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is designed to be fast, scalable, and durable. It has 3 key capabilities:

1.	It lets you publish and subscribe to streams of records. In this respect it is similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
2.	It lets you store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way.
3.	It lets you process streams of records as they occur.

It gets used for two broad classes of application:

1.	Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
2.	Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data

### HADOOP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. To understand Hadoop, there are two fundamental things about it -  How Hadoop stores files and how it processes data.The framework that is used in hadoop to process data is called MapReduce.

All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common and should be automatically handled by the framework. The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part, known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and a processing part called MapReduce. Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster.

Example : Imagine a file that is larger than the capacity of a computer then it would not be possible to store that file. Hadoop allows to store files bigger than what can be stored on one particular node or server. So it provides an ability to store very, very large files and also lets to store many, many files.

The script (run.sh) submits the spark task to cluster. There are  the primarily five Input parameters that are used in run.sh which are as follows: </br>

<b>Parameter 1</b> : Kafka Address -> Kafka broker IP Address</br>
<b>Parameter 2</b> : Kafka Topic -> Kafka Topic text</br>
<b>Parameter 3</b> : $HADOOP_USER_NAME -> login username</br>
<b>Parameter 4</b> : Hadoop Path -> HDFS Path where the face image would be stored. The program detects face from streaming data and saves the images back to HDFS path specified</br>
<b>Parameter 5</b> : Run Duration :  Duration for which the application would run. By default it is set as 5 mins. However, It could be changed by the user.</br>

### <b>Step 9 : Start service - videostream</b>

* Start the service in Data Source(videostream). Please refer screenshot below:

* if the service is in started status intially, please stop it first and start it again as detailed above and If the service is in stopped status then, click on it to start again. 

### <b>Step 10 : View output images from DLP</b>

Next, we will view the file that has face images from DLP Platform. The spark task detected the images from the video streaming and saved them into the HDFS path (mentioned in run.sh - Refer step 13 for more details). 

* Navigate to Data Source -> File. The output file generated will be listed. Please refer the screenshot below for more       details:

P.S: Here face.jpeg is an generated image file which is created in a regular time interval and stored in DLP's Hadoop platform.  The image gets updated at  regular time intervals.

As an example we have used only small set of data for streaming in our application as a result of which different face images are getting generated and saved in the hadoop platform based on the timestamp. This process will continue till the stream data gets finished.In this example, we are viewing images at two different time intervals.

### <b>Step 11 : Stop services - eclipse and videostream </b>

After viewing the images from DLP environment, we need to stop the video source micro-service and the cloud IDE from DLP. 

1. Navigate to the DLP ->WorkSpace > Video Analytics using Apache Spark Streaming -> Tools and Microservices > Data Source -> Videostream -> Click on Stop. 

2. Navigate to the DLP ->WorkSpace > Video Analytics using Apache Spark Streaming -> Tools and Microservices > Cloud IDE -> eclipse -> Click on Stop.
